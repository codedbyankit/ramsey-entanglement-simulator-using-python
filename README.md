ðŸ§ª Rydberg Entanglement Simulation using Python
This project simulates quantum entanglement in Rydberg atoms using Ramsey interferometry, inspired by the PRL 2020 work from Prof. Jaewook Ahn's group at KAIST.

It models:

Two-atom interaction via van der Waals phase shift (Î±)

The effect of entanglement on Ramsey fringe visibility

The transition from coherent superposition to entangled mixed states

All of this is done using pure Python + NumPy + Matplotlib, making quantum theory visual, interactive, and accessible â€” no quantum hardware required.

ðŸ“ˆ Features
Plot Ramsey fringes for entangled & non-entangled cases

Simulate visibility as a function of interaction strength

Visualize Bloch sphere trajectories of quantum states

Understand how distance between atoms controls entanglement

ðŸ§  Why this matters:
It turns deep quantum physics into intuitive plots and equations â€” ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts exploring neutral-atom quantum computing.
