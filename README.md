# ramsey-entanglement-simulator-using-python
A Python-based simulation of Ramsey interferometry in Rydberg atoms, inspired by Prof. Jaewook Ahnâ€™s PRL 2020 paper. Models quantum entanglement via phase shifts, visualizes Ramsey fringes, and demonstrates how interference vanishes when atoms become entangled.
